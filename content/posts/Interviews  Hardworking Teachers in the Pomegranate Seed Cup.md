## Is there any award-winning work that you are more impressed with and like?

Diao Yan: The students in the non-professional group are versatile. Some of the students were very good at dancing, which surprised me and made me feel that they chose the wrong specialty! The subject matter is also very good, like "Youth to the Party", and "Tang Palace Night Banquet" (this time took the first prize), these works are particularly excellent.

Bartels: We selected the non-professional group of works after the selection from the School of Dance and sent some excellent graduate students specifically to Elm in the pre-competition guidance, polishing, and modification of the work so that the dance can have a better enhancement. Like "Youth to the Party", it reflects the youthful vigor of contemporary college students and at the same time expresses the initial heart of contemporary college students to the Party. There is also "Tang Palace Banquet", although it is a student performance work, the actors in the process of performance, I do not feel that they are a non-professional group of students.

Mubarak: "The Power of Faith" is a work that impressed me a lot. It is mainly about the soldiers at the border who fight hard to defend the country's borders. This power of faith can make oneself always upward, conveying positive energy. This is very much in line with the theme of this gala, and it is also one of our very classic works.

## Do you think there are any changes in this edition of the "ShiLiuZi" compared to the previous one?

Diao Yan: Of course there are changes, and there are more works. Compared with the previous years, this year should be the biggest one. The last edition was mainly online to submit video works, and then do the selection; this year is offline, in the quantity and quality of works have been greatly improved.

Bartels: "ShiLiuZi" Dance Championship is now in its second year, and was not organized in previous years for several reasons. Compared to previous years, the number of entries, the coverage of colleges, and the number of students participating in this year's competition have all increased significantly. This year, there are professional and non-professional groups, and there are nearly hundreds of solo dances and single and double triple entries. Whether it is a group dance work or a solo or duo work, the subject matter is very wide. There are works reflecting traditional folk dance culture, eulogizing the red gene and the spirit of the red revolution, as well as popular dance works reflecting the positivity and youthfulness of contemporary college students....... In a word, the works are more diversified in the form of themes.

## Do you have any thoughts about the perfect ending of the party? Or would you like to say something to the students?

Bartels: I hope that students can participate in more programs related to aesthetics while completing their studies. I think these programs can not only play a role in strengthening the body, but more importantly, can enhance the students' aesthetics, broaden their knowledge of traditional culture, and improve their self-confidence.

## What is the outlook or expectation for the next "ShiLiuZi"?

Diao Yan: I hope that more and more students will register and the quality of the work will get better and better, and I hope that there will be more and more linkages between the two campuses.

Bartels: We hope that the non-majors on the Yuzhong Campus side will produce some more fine works in the next edition. This time, many of their works were out of my expectation, and I didn't feel that they were non-professionals at all during the performance. Their costumes and makeup were very detailed, which also showed that they were very dedicated and serious about this competition. So I hope that more non-majors will participate in the program in our third and fourth sessions.

Mubarak: This event is very meaningful. Although dance majors practice every day, they have limited opportunities to perform and participate in the competition, and this event kind of provides them with a stage and a chance to show themselves. For some non-majors on the Elmhurst Campus, this is also an opportunity to train themselves. Because I am a non-professional judge, I can see the works of many non-professional students, who are very good and professional. Through this activity, we can find more talents, and I hope that the "ShiLiuZi" School Dance Competition will be better and better.

Ma Runchun: I hope it will get better and better, it will get better and better. Because each college pays more attention to this competition, the arts are more diversified, and everyone has a high degree of enthusiasm. When the number of works is more and the presentation is diversified, its quality will be improved. So I believe it will get better and better.
