## Summary
Preparation, stage walking, light pairing, hyping, venue discipline ...... Behind every glittering party, there is always a group of silent staff. They are the planners, the directors, the hosts, the persons in charge of the venue discipline, the guardians of the evening party, and the hermits who are busy in the corner of the performance site. The light in front of the stage belongs to the actors, and the light behind the stage belongs to them. The 2nd "ShiLiuZi" School Dance Competition Award Gala allowed us to interview these staff members and get closer to them to see more stories behind the stage.

## The Light Behind the Stage

On a chilly winter morning at Minzu University, the staff of the School of Dance at the headquarters of the university set out on a trip to Yuchong wearing thick cotton jackets.

Arriving at the Yuchong Campus, they rushed to the Basketball Hall and began their work for the day. Since most of the staff members were students, it was their first time to come to the Yuzhong Campus, and they didn't know much about the basketball and volleyball halls, and the venue wasn't fully set up. At first, they were a bit overwhelmed, but under the arrangement of the leaders in charge, the work slowly became orderly, and everyone did their work seriously and carefully.

Asked about the preparations for the event, Li Yumei, who was taking pictures in front of the stage, said with a slight concern: "When the 'ShiLiuZi' began to plan and prepare, we have been preparing for it, and it has been more than a month. But still worried, afraid of some unforeseen circumstances, such as sound microphone failure on site, the wrong award, the night lights being too dark performers falling, and so on. In addition, most of us are coming to the Yucheng Campus for the first time, and we don't know a lot about the situation, all of these add difficulties to our work and make me a little worried".

To better cope with these unexpected difficulties, Li Yumei and the party staff to the possible problems and coping strategies in advance to do the relevant planning and preparation. Li Yumei said: "I will get in touch with the students of Yuchong Campus in advance and learn about the situation of Yuchong Campus from them. After arriving at the site, I would walk the venue over and over again, from the front of the stage to the back of the stage, looking for the best place to take pictures, and at the same time checking the deficiencies in our preparations. Every time I walk down, I have different gains and feelings, and I learn new knowledge and skills to better cope with any problems that may arise".

In addition to the busy Li Yumei, at the site, the award presenters were standing beside the table carefully sorting out the thick certificates of awards; the staff in charge of music collection and playback were beside the stage to accurately control the time and debug the sound time and time again; the general manager rehearsed the order of appearances with the performers over and over again; and the staff in charge of the pre-event setup were running in the Basketball & Volleyball Hall with microphones in hand to check the safety facilities of the venue.

They were in a hurry, but meticulous. In the past, I only saw the actors and actresses shining in front of the stage, but I didn't pay attention to the light behind the stage, which also shone so brightly.

## Working Together

Zhang Ruonan, the student in charge of the event, said: "In fact, during the preparation of the event, there are still many things, including the pre-event planning program and how to prepare for the event, and then the whole evening party process, the awarding process, and the program show some big and small things need to be prepared. The division of labor of the student union personnel is also quite complicated, need to count the teachers, actors, and staff-related information. Teachers also worked very hard for this event, working overtime every day and leaving the office very late. Everyone worked hard, but we all persevered, and we believe everything will go in a good direction."

Zhang Yu, who is in charge of the venue setup, said, "The setup before and after the stage, the arrangement of personnel, and the order of each program on the stage are all more troublesome, and there will be some disputes. For us, there will certainly be different opinions, but we will try to communicate as much as possible, and try to do our best, together to solve these difficulties."

Wan Zhanshi, the person in charge of venue discipline, said with emotion, "I am not a person with a strong sense of discipline, and I have a bad memory, always forgetting things. When I first started to prepare for this event, I would often get the order of appearance wrong, and wrong and have to start again, delaying everyone a lot of time." One mistake at a time made Wan Zhan Xiao begins to doubt himself, he was afraid of screwing up. "But then, I watched and I am responsible for the evening party work with the students meticulously do every tedious thing, they control the music over and over again to play the time, repeated every day to read the script, busy in the venue corners ...... want to prepare the show to the best, so I want to do my best! Do this job well, can not live up to everyone's hard work."

For the behind-the-scenes staff, difficulties are common in preparing for the whole event. If we can work together to solve the difficulties, and if we can work together and help each other, all difficulties will be solved. Doing something seriously with everyone is of extraordinary significance to each of them. In this activity, we overcame the difficulties together, grew up together, helped each other in the same boat, and believed that there would be a straight path.

## Looking at the distant mountains and walking forward

Inspiration from the seniors became the main reason for the students to actively participate in the behind-the-scenes work. Li Yan and Feng Junfeng, the staff in charge of setting up and closing the venue, said, "We are freshmen and we don't know much about anything, but when we heard that the college was going to prepare for this event and needed manpower and that there were older students to lead the event, we thought that we could learn something from them, so we volunteered to come. We followed the seniors to learn how to set up the venue, design and build the stage background, props, lighting, and other elements according to the theme of the party and the content of the program to create a stage effect that meets the atmosphere of the program, etc. ...... We learned a lot from our seniors and they encouraged us when we did not do enough so that we have a force inside to support us to continue to go forward. Now, we follow the footsteps of our elder sisters and exercise our abilities, and later we can pick up the college banner and continue to work hard, knowing the inadequacy and advancing, looking at the distant mountains and moving forward."

At the end of the interview, Zhang Ruonan, the student in charge of the event, talked about her gains: "I have been responsible for organizing many events, but each time I gained and learned something different. I have been responsible for organizing many events, but every time I have gained and learned something different. These gains cannot be measured in terms of the amount of time. Even though sometimes you don't necessarily learn a lot by spending a lot of time, you learn something by spending time. In this activity, my biggest gain is to know 'learning', worthy of my learning object is not necessarily having a lot of experience as seniors, but also can be involved in our activities of the younger students. In them, I learned the humility of asking others for advice and a scholarly spirit, seeing them I saw myself at the beginning, eager to understand everything in the world, brave to face the difficulties and challenges in life, and with fearless courage to explore the unknown world. I love their scholarly spirit and positive attitude towards the future, and I hope I can be as energetic as they are."

A wonderful party performance includes a dazzling performance on the stage, the applause of the audience under the stage, and the behind-the-scenes staff who are busy in the corners of the venue. A stage, there are you, there are I, there are also them. They also have light, bright, and shine on the stage.
